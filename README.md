## C Refresher I

Goal: Write 5 different sorting algorithms in C, packaging them as a tarball.

The directory for each sorting algorithm should contain a prog.c, several input/output txts, and a Makefile.

The Makefile builds prog.c and tests it using Valgrind and gcov. gcov should cover 100% of all lines in the code.
